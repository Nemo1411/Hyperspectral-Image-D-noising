# Hyperspectral Image Denoising with Deep Learning

## Description
This project aims to develop a denoising system for hyperspectral images using Deep Learning techniques. We primarily focus on utilizing the Pavia University (PaviaU) dataset, widely used in the community for hyperspectral image processing research.

## Objectives
- Implement a Deep Learning model for denoising hyperspectral images.
- Experiment with different deep neural network architectures to optimize denoising performance.
- Provide an open-source tool for the hyperspectral image processing community.

## Dataset
We will use the Pavia University (PaviaU) dataset for training, validation, and testing of our model. This dataset consists of hyperspectral images acquired by an airborne sensor over the city of Pavia, Italy.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language for model implementation.
- TensorFlow: Deep Learning libraries for model creation and training.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computation.
- Matplotlib: Library for data visualization.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nemo1411/hyperspectral-Image-Denoising.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r numpy
   pip install -r keras
   pip install -r scipy
   pip install -r tensorflow
   pip install -r matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
1. Download the entire dataset.
2. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBKR9ucK3V_HEbZRJktAGf7QGSzaWE7L/view?usp=sharing
3. Place the data files in the `data/hsi_data/demo` directory.
4. Run the model training script.

## Help function
Those functions are juste here to help set up a dataset

## Note:
Increase the number of iterations for better results.
Or use the pretrained models to see different results
